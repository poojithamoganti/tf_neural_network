# tf_neural_network
Three layers of neural network using TensorFlow 

The first layer (input layer) has four neurons, the second layer has five neurons, and the third layer (output layer) has only one neuron. 

Trying the same experience with the same number of neurons you used in each layer. 

Using at least two different activation function and two different optimization functions. 

Plot your cost function.
